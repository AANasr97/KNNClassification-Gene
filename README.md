# KNN - K Nearest Neighbors - Classification

Welcome to the KNN Classification Project! In this project, we explore the application of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks using a synthetic dataset related to gene expression levels. The goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of using KNN for classification in this context. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and key components.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Dataset Description:
   - Analyze a synthetic dataset related to gene expression levels.
   - Explore the features, including "Gene One," "Gene Two," and the target variable "Cancer Present."

2. Data Visualization:
   - Visualize the dataset by creating scatterplots and pair plots to gain insights into the relationship between gene expression and cancer presence.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Prepare the data for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets.
   - Scale the features using standardization to ensure fair comparisons.

4. K Nearest Neighbors Model:
   - Build a KNN classification model with the choice of K=1 initially.
   - Understand the concept of KNN and evaluate its performance on the test data.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Explore the Elbow Method to choose a reasonable value of K.
   - Perform a full cross-validation grid search to find the optimal K value for the KNN model.

6. Final Model Evaluation:
   - Create a final KNN model with the recommended K value.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the hold-out test set.
